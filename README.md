## About
A script (for bitbar) that outputs USD balances of your Ethereum wallets, and all tokens.  
Can be used outside of bitbar - just run directly.  

Uses coinmarketcap.com for ETH price quotes.  
Uses ethexplorer.io to fetch wallet, its tokens, and prices.

You may also need to update the path to python3 on the first line...
